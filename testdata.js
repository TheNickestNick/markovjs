As far as I know.\n\nHaving sex (herein using the narrow definition of being vaginally penetrating with a penis) doesn't cause much of a long-lasting difference to a vagina, other than, generally (excepting sexual dysfunctions or rape) through vasocongestion, which, from the average male participants' point of view makes a vagina \"feel looser\" as it \"expands\" with blood. However, obviously, this is a very good thing, seeing as how you can't really have pleasurable (again, generally speaking) sex with an unaroused vagina. Shit just hurts for both parties.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasocongestion\n\nTemporary \"activity\" can also lead to temporary alteration of a vagina. For instance, double penetration or penetration with a particularly large object can cause micro-fissures in the vaginal tissue (or not so micro-fissures as the case may be, sorry ladies). The vagina, much like the penis, is made out of tissue that is specifically evolved to allow for frequent expansion and contraction. Barring some kind of major damage, any effect from \"normal\" sexual activity will be unnoticeable very quickly, almost certainly within a few hours to a day.\n\nJust like penises, vaginas are meant to change their shape frequently throughout a woman's day, let alone her entire lifetime. Again, the frequency, duration, number of instances of sex, or number of sexual partners is unlikely to have any long lasting effect on the \"tightness\" of a woman's vagina, either by making it \"looser\" or \"tighter.\"\n\nThe vagina is NOT a muscle in the sense that you mean. You're probably referring to the pubococcygeus muscles of the pelvic floor, the things that ladies supposedly \"work out\" with Kegel exercises. What research has been done on this doesn't really have overwhelming evidence to support that it has any real effect.\n\nFrom my personal experience (anecdotal evidence here) from being with women that have routinely performed Kegel exercises, I'd say that they do often exhibit a greater tightness, but I think it might be due more to their overall level of fitness. I've just never been with an unfit woman that did Kegel exercises to test a before and after scenario.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise\n\nThe three main factors for a woman's vaginal \"tightness\" are genetics, age (due to her current estrogen levels), and trauma. I covered some of the issues of trauma above, but just to get the point across, studies seem to indicate that most of the vaginal differences women think they feel after giving vaginal birth are often subjective. This basically means that the vagina is so resilient that something that's like... 50 times bigger than a penis can come out of it, and in a few weeks or months, that sucker is right back in fighting shape. However, of course there are exceptions.\n\nMuch like penis size, vaginal tightness is mainly related to genetics and a woman's current level of arousal.\n\nThe last major factor has to do with estrogen. The estrogen hormone makes vaginal tissue swell more, thus giving it a \"tighter\" feel. As women age, they experience a lessening of estrogen, especially after menopause. Women can often experience major hormonal fluctuations after childbirth, too, which often reinforces the notion of the vagina getting \"looser\" because of birth. No doubt, many people even to this day associate the idea of more sex or more sexual partners (two phenomena which require time, and thus, are more likely to go up over a longer period of time) with a \"looser\" vagina. In reality, over time, it's normal for a woman's vagina to thin out due to ebbing estrogen levels.\n\nThe estrogen cycle is also one of the primary reasons that women tend to feel \"looser\" as their period approaches.\n\nAnyway, if you want a tight pussy, don't do anything to gnarly to it, maybe do some Kegels if you're like... super worried about it or something, but for the most part, just like a dude's downstairs equipment, you've got what you were born with.\n\nPersonally, sexual skill is much more important to me than physical characteristics. I'd take a chick with a loose pussy that's fucking super down to pound, and knows what she's doing and has a fun time with it, over an ignorant virgin packing a hymen wrapped vag any day.\n\nSo on that level, I'd totally agree with you.
